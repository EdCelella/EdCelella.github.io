        							<p>Hi and welcome to my website. Here you will find a catalogue of some of the projects I have created whilst at university and during my personal time. This particular page will hopefully EDucate you about me and some of the interests I hold.</p>
        							<br>
        							<p>I'm currently finishing my second year of my computer science degree, studying at Nottingham Trent University. During my time I have developed my programming; mathematical; and problem-solving skills. Currently I have taken a variety of modules which include topics from databases and networking to graphics and applied mathematics.  Next year I will be continuing my studies further in modules such as Artificial Intelligence and Cloud Computing.</p>
        							<br>
        							<p>My primary programming languages are C++ and Java. Having used them primarily throughout my degree. However, I am also proficient in Python; SQL; HTML; CSS; JavaScript and PHP. Many examples of my work in these languages can be found on the projects page. I also implement a variety of tools during my projects/work to ensure my work is of the highest quality. These include version control software (GIT and Mercurial) as well as continuous integration servers (Jenkins) coupled with testing libraries (Boost UTF).</p>
        							<br>
        							<p>During my free time I work on personal projects, as well as attending hackathon events such as Hack 24. Currently I also work on my final year project. My project involves looking at the relationship between news stories and the stock prices of companies. The end goal is to hopefully build a system which can track news stories of a company, then by using a natural language processor, determine what the story is about and how positive or negative the story is. These results will then be fed into a neural network which will try to predict the effect it will have on the stock price.</p>
        							<br>
        							<p>Finance and economics are topics I am deeply interested in and are fields I wish to enter once I conclude my studies. However, I also have an enthusiasm for security and nearly all fields of artificial intelligence.</p>
        							<br>
        							<p>When I’m not programming my favourite past time is listening to music. This is either at home, or attending music festivals/live gigs. Music is something I have a deep passion for and many of my projects revolve around using music.</p>
        							<br>
        							<p>Thanks for taking the time to check out my website. Feel free to get in touch using the contact us page and hope you have a lovely day wherever you are.</p>

        									<h4> Website </h4>
          									<p>I built this web page in order to demonstrate my knowledge of website development. The front end was build using HTML and CSS. The majority of the project was built using the standard versions, however CSS3 was used for the load animation and Bootstrap for the models. The backend was built using JavaScript and PHP, in order to send emails and display notifications to the user. Click on the image adjacent to be taken to the GIT repository of the project.</p>

        									<h4> Hitify </h4>
          									<p>Hitify is a social networking application, built for sharing and uploading music. The entire application was built using java and comes in three parts. Firstly, there is the client which is used to log in and display a user’s news feed; music; friends and messages. Secondly is the music server which receives requests from the client and interacts with the database. Third and finally is the music server which keeps track of chat history between users, and displays new messages when a user logs on. All servers are multithreaded, and the GUI is built using Swing.

        									<h4> Trek Star </h4>
          									<p>Trek Star is a program built for a university project. Its purpose is to keep track information about film projects. The entire project was built using C++, using QT as the front end. The back end of the systems uses an object orientated approach, creating an object for each project. These objects are stored in a linked list for access. Click on the image adjacent to be taken to the GIT repository of the project.</p>

                          <h4> Chess </h4>
                            <p>For my first-year project I had to produce a programme using python. I decided to produce a chess game which can be played against two people. The program uses data dictionaries in order to track the positions of all the pieces, and also another to store the legal moves for each piece. The front end was built using Pygame.
