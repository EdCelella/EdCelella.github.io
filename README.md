# Personal Website

This repository contains the code for my Github page. As Github Pages is a static site hosting service, only HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript are utilised. The project does contain PHP code for sending emails, which can be used if a dynamic hosting service is utilised.

The website can be viewed [here](https://edcelella.github.io/).

## Prerequisites

For the static version of the site, only a browser is required to run the site. If you wish to run the PHP code then a web server will be required.

## Acknowledgements

The following third-party libraries were utilised for this project:

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - Used for the modal boxes.
- [SmtpJs](https://smtpjs.com/) - Used to send emails on the static version of the website.
